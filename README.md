# reddy-shravali-webdev

Hi, I'm Shravali and I'm currently an undergraduate student at Northeastern University. I just finished a six month co-op at Nanthealth working as a software developer.

The purpose of this repository is for the assignments and projects I complete in my Web Development course here at Northeastern.
